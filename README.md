## Sarah Risley

Dedicated and motivated Junior Software Developer with a strong passion for coding and problem-solving. Previously I worked as an experienced NHS nurse in a variety of clinical settings and also on the front line during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Whilst I enjoyed my time as a nurse I have always wanted to pursue a career in tech and spent my free time learning some programming fundamentals. 
Makers Academy bootcamp has given me even more hands-on knowledge and experience including delivering projects from design all the way through to deployment and I am incredibly exictied to put my knoweldge and skills to good use.

## Work Experience

_Coach_

- Coaching small group classes in both CrossFit, gymnastics, olympic weightlifting. This allowed me to transition from my nursing career and begin my self taught tech journey. I left a full time position here to start the Makers Academy bootcamp but remain employed on a part-time/ad-hoc basis to cover coaching classes as I really enjoy it.

## Skills

#### Object Oriented Programming 
- Through my own study and more recently through my bootcamp with Makers Academy I have developed a solid understanding and profecieny with OOP, particularly with Javascript and Python. I feel very confident working with OOP languages and I am able to produce high quality, readable, resuable and scalable code.

#### Test Driven Development
- Makers Academy had a very strong focus on TDD and this has become an invaluable habit I practice when writing any code. It allows my code to be clear, concise and allows for very easy and/or minmal debugging. Every project I completed at Makers used TDD which meant that even as the codebase started to scale signifcantly, there was high test coverage throughout, it remained high quality and ran exactly as intended. 
  
#### Communication
- As a frontline nurse working in high acuity areas such as intensive care and A&E, strong communication skills were imperative. It was essential to be able to clearly communicate roles, tasks and instructions in acute and high pressure situations.
Additionally, I was able to clearly and empathetically communicate with patients, friends and relatives in order to update them on situations without over complicating or using medical jargon. I believe this will be hugely beneficial when working with a team of developers as I can clearly and coherently explaining the purpose of my code even in a complex code base. I can also confidently explain the functionaility to non-technical clients. 
- Similarly, as a sports coach, particularly when coaching a sport as technical as Olympic Weightlifting or gymnastics, it is incredible important that I can clearly explain and instruct how a movement is to be performed and ensure the client understands not only how but why the movement is performed in this way. This ensures the client is safe and also is able to enjoy the learning process and feel supported.

#### Time management
- It was essential to be able to clerly manage tasks and prioritse appropriately whilst working in A&E during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Depsite the high pressure environment I was able to clearly triage and prioritse tasks to maintain patient safety.
- As a sports coach who runs group classes, it is incredibly important I manage my time appropriately to ensure the memebers are warmed up and primed to move safely, understand the movements they will be perfroming and to make sure the class runs to time and is enjoyable for all.
- I feel these time management skills have set me up very well to ensure I am able to keep to tight deadlines and manage and prioritse tasks to ensure these are met.

#### Teamwork
- All of my previous work experience has involved working within a larger and often multidisciplinary team. More recently I have gained invaluable experience of working within a team of developers through my bootcamp with Makers Academy. In each team project we adhered to agile working methodolgies in order to work efficiently and ultimately produce high quality projects. This involved daily standups, frequent retros and having open channels of communcaition to in order to work effectively, with each developer or pair working on clear, prioritsed tasks.
